# BikeSharing
#### *Created a story and multiple dashboards to analyze and visualize citi bikes data using Tableau and Python*

## Overview
This project consisted on creating a pitch for a citi bike (bikesharing) business proposal for angel investors looking to seed fund. The goal was to look at citibike data in New York City on the month of august to look how this bikesharing business operates in its prime during summer. After analyzing the data and cleaning it up a bit, I then created visualizations to display the trends and opportunities it would have in other cities.

Trips by Customer Type and Gender - Here we can look at what kind of users use citibikes. This can be used to target potential clients in Des Moines through specified advertising (Try to get users to subscribe and target specific gender audiences).

When and How Long Bike Sharing Used in General - We can use the visualizations in this section of the story to set up maintenance schedules and how many bikes are needed at any given time.

When and How Long Bike Sharing Used by Gender - This section shows how bike utilization by time and gender. To keep a gender using a bike longer to increase profits, we can have a targeted gameplan of incentives that appeal to a particular gender (i.e. discounts, 3rd party coupons if ride lasts certain length).

## Summary
Further analysis is needed for Des Moines. We can look at figures that show bike utilization by geography in Des Moines to help target where bikes should go. Furthermore, looking at citibike data by user type in different cities from where the user is registered would be a good figure to show how many bike rides are used on vacation vs local traffic.
